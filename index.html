        <h3>Greetings</h3>

<p>I started this project back in 2009.  Mostly to try and assist anyone new to Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), used for e-learning and portability between Learning Management (LMS) systems.  There are a few 3rd Party libraries out there, and I wanted something more complete, and open so the rest of the net is engaged.  E-Learning is really a end-to-end journey that can have you pulling your hair out at multiple levels.  I wanted to roll up all the things we commonly do into logical interfaces that give you the option to go commando, or take the kitchen sink with you.  We've all been 'that guy' at some point lugging around hundreds of kilobytes of JavaScript and only using a small subset of its functionality.  I wanted to keep this around &lt; 30KB as a full featured support for SCORM 2004, and like I mentioned, if you choose for just base support, keep it much smaller &lt; 10KB.  Normally, after a while though you'll start needing more rich API support to handle scoring, interactions, objectives and all the calls you have to make long hand.  SCOBot simplifies this a bit by boiling up several direct SCORM calls into one API so you don't have to do the guess work.  There are however times when your making a single SCORM call, and I didn't go to the trouble of making more custom hooks for one-to-one calls.
This project does assume you're using JQuery, if not, you can go to the extent to replace some of the features I used with counterparts or utilities for things like <code>$.isPlainObject</code>, <code>$.isArray</code>, <code>$.extend</code> etc ...  I have considered removing the dependency.</p>

<h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>

<p>SCORM is not a web service.  Though it does pass data back and forth, the LMS manages this from client to server.  As a Shareable Content Object (SCO) we connect directly to a local variable the LMS provides called <code>API_1484_11</code>.  Or if you're in SCORM 1.2 its just called <code>API</code>.  This is JavaScript-to-JavaScript communication.  No frills, no gimmicks and the Content SCORM_API/SCOBot I've written will connect directly with the LMS and begin to take over to do all the things we commonly need SCORM to do.  I've been in several situations where people tend to think SCORM comes with all the functionality needed to remain true to the specification, but this is not the case.  It does however, supply you the mechanisms to get and set values in a organized Computer Managed Instruction (CMI) object.  End of the day its really a Communication and Packaging specification.
This project is not the LMS Runtime either.  I know anyone eager to start working with SCORM and their next question is: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where can I get the LMS Runtime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer is there are some paid libraries or services online.<br>
If your willing to make your own, I have a <code>Local_API_1484_11.js</code> in the project for running locally and pretending to be a LMS when no LMS is present.  This is a very lean spoof of the LMS <code>API_14_84_11</code>.  This would be a primer for getting started on your own.  But, remember the flow works the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Student Logs in to LMS</li>
<li>Student chooses an Assignment</li>
<li>LMS Presents TOC or single SCO</li>
<li>Student selects content, and the LMS must prepare the CMI object before the SCO loads</li>
<li>SCO searches for the <code>API_1484_11</code>, and will Initialize</li>
<li>SCO can now make get/set value calls</li>
<li>Commit call will tell the LMS to store the CMI object to the Server</li>
<li>Terminate call will end the SCO session with a exit type of suspend, normal, logout, time-out or ""</li>
</ul><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3459294/scorm/client-puzzle.jpg" alt="Client Puzzle"></p>

<p>SCORM is really like plumbing.  They give you namespaces, and a pipeline to communicate.  They often make suggestions, set limits, data formats and time formats, but for the most part you fill in this information.
The LMS Runtime is really just a controller.  It's managing preparing the data, and allowing you to interact with it.  There are things you can and can't do, and it will throw errors when you do something your not suppose to.  If you are a database developer or familiar with this, its kind of like talking to a defined database, but there are more rules about what you can read and write to.  SCORM is entirely string based.  So a sample call <code>var bookmark = lms.GetValue('cmi.location');</code> will return the value for the location the SCO has set.  If you are familiar with working with JSON, or native objects in JavaScript, know that you can't just call <code>cmi.location</code> and yield the same result.  The LMS Runtime manages the interface to this data.</p>

<p>I will circle back later to briefly cover the administration/packaging element to SCORM to tie in the Content Aggregation Model (CAM) Package visually, and how that plugs in.</p>

<h3>Dissemination</h3>

<p>I'm slowly building up the Wiki documentation to try and address common questions I get from an array of people working at all levels of training and teaching.  From Instructional Design, Requirements, Implementation, Release and a Package, we have to be involved at all levels.  How to score, track progress, record interactions and identify success.  Some of this will be opinion, and at the end of the day I think thats going to be the lesson here.  SCORM is really an active opinion of recording student activity over the last decade.  How you apply it is really up to you.  Not everything is perfect either. You will run into things it can't do due to arbitrary limitations with in the specification.  Often I find some of these limitations are just originally suggestions and its ultimately up to how the LMS treats and enforces them.</p>

<h3>QUnit Tests</h3>

<p>These are meant to show SCORM behaviors with each variation of how you could use the project. With SCOBot added or just the SCORM_API doing everything longhand yourself.  Lastly, the production version with the scripts minified, and packed.  You will see a range of 100 more tests based on how you run the unit tests.  They will behave differently on resume than they would during a first run.  The tests are not set in stone either, feel free to make adjustments within the <code>js/test/</code> folder respectively.

You absolutely can use these to test a LMS for SCORM support.  If your having trouble understanding what the tests entail or prove/justify I will be adding documentation to the Wiki in time to cover step by step the unit tests in detail.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>I'm Mark Statkus (<a href="https://github.com/cybercussion" class="user-mention">@cybercussion</a>) and have worked with e-learning since the early 2000's. When I'm not doing this I'm shredding on electric drums, which hopefully explains my handle.
I've relied on several friends to stress test, and guide my efforts.
Brandon Bradley (<a href="https://github.com/brandonbradley" class="user-mention">@brandonbradley</a>) contributed schemas, diagrams, a virtual shoulder to cry on, and helping me get thru all the specification PDF's unscathed. 
I'd like to thank the guys over as (<a href="http://cloud.scorm.com">cloud.scorm.com</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/RusticiSoftware">Rustici</a>) for furnishing SCORM with some validation and sanity checking because of of this was pretty rough to verify even with the documentation.  I'd also like to Claude Ostyn for his publishings online and tools.</p>
